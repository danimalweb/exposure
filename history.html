It first started in 1997 when John McNair and Jake Gully noticed they were both musical and decided to do something about it. John Played keyboards, sang when he had to and knew most chords for the guitar. Jake had been playing the guitar for four years but was sticking with the drums, something that he'd only been playing for a year.
Unfortunately just the two couldn't perform anything decent. We needed something else...we needed a guitarist and someone that didn't mind singing.
First came the guitarist, Martin Bayly, probably the best guitarist in our school, but we still needed a singer. John would sing but reluctantly and we kept looking for people who could sing. Eventually we found Jess Felce.
We had a few gigs at school under a variety of names (Stone Walls, Mirage, Mirror Image). After seven weeks of summer holidays in which we hadn't had a single practice and we weren't getting anywhere, Martin and Jess left.
For a while Jake and John carried on doing a small set on two guitars with their two voices. By now John had sung in school productions and didn't mind doing it now.
Soon we found Nick Morgan. He had been learning the guitar for a while, basically by listening to songs and getting the chords and chord diagrams from the Internet. Nick is also a decent French horn player and has two professional musicians as parents which made him great at music theory which is useful.
Together the three of us made a band, John singing and playing rhythm guitar, Jake on drums and Nick on bass on the bottom strings of an old classical guitar. He bought his first real bass five days before our first gig.
Soon we were joined again by Martin. We have now found out that Martin can write words. So now we are working on our own songs rather than doing covers.
After a while we thought that it would be nice to have some backing singers so we asked Alex Balster and Ella Kedge. They had sung at school before and we all new them.
Unfortunately this set up was too complicated: we had enough trouble getting to the same practices with the four of us let alone six, so, unfortunately, they went.
And that is how (and who) we are today. We have played plenty of gigs in barns, school halls and parties, we've played in front of over one thousand people at a time and at 3:15 in the morning. We are hoping for a gig at New Year's eve, but the pub we were going to play at has a new management and we can't. If anyone knows of a place where we can play (one-off or regular) then e-mail us at <A HREF="mailto:theband@exposure.zzn.com" onmouseover = "window.status = 'theband@exposure.zzn.com'; return true; " onmouseout = "window.status = ' '; return true;">theband@exposure.zzn.com</A><BR><BR><CENTER>
