This page is best viewed at 800x600 with as many colors as you can get with a 100mb/second modem (shame you can't get them yet).  Also, if you aren't using IE4.0 or higher then some things won't work properly.  If your computer can't do that then get a new one.  Get a new one any way!  Give those people who make the bloody things a job.  And give us the old ones.<BR><BR>

<TR> 
	<TD><BR>Anyway...<BR><BR>Exposure is a British band from Stroud in Gloucestershire playing rock music.  They don't gig much at the moment because they are busy writing their first album (and essays that should have been in last year).  They should have some of their own music on this site soon but they've got to record it first.  If you own a pub in the Stroud area and are looking for a band to do gigs then they are available at a 
small charge. They're good, but will need until at least after christmas if you want their own material.  They do covers at the moment because they have trouble with words - the music is fine!  Please explore the site with the bar on the left.
